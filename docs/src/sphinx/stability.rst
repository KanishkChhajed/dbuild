Stability
=========

.. _section-stability:

The ``stability`` section
-------------------------

If you used spaces to build multiple versions of the same artifacts, you can also
automatically compare them, to make sure their content is identical. The "stability"
section implements an automatic artifact comparison. The content of the corresponding
section is the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    build: {projects:..., options:...}
    
    options: {
     deploy: ...

     stability: [{
       a : [<project1>,<project2>,...]
       b : [<project1>,<project2>,...]
     }, ... ]
    }
   }

The specification of the lists of projects is the same previously described in :ref:`section-deploy`.
At the end of the compilation, dbuild will compare the jars generated by the two lists of projects
(ignoring their manifests). If the comparison fails, a report of the differences will be printed,
and the final build outcome will reflect the error condition. The two sides are always identified
by using "a" and "b" as labels.
