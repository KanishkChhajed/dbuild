What is it?
-----------
dbuild, or distributed-build, is a build tool used to coordinating multiple, independent projects
that are simultaneously under development, and that may evolve independently while relying on one another.
The aim of the tool is to make sure that changes in one or more of those projects do not adversely affect
the entire network of inter-dependent project. Further, dbuild offers facilities that simplify debugging in
the case in which the compilation of the group of projects should fail.
